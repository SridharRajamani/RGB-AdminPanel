# Events Integration Demo

## What I've Implemented

I've successfully connected the Admin Panel Event Management with the Landing Page Events section using localStorage. Here's how it works:

### Admin Panel Event Management (`src/pages/AdminPanel/event-management/index.jsx`)

1. **localStorage Integration**: Events are now saved to and loaded from localStorage
2. **Service Categories**: Added service category field to events (Club Service, Community Service, etc.)
3. **Real-time Updates**: When events are created/modified, they automatically sync to localStorage
4. **Custom Events**: Dispatches `eventsDataUpdated` event to notify other components

### Landing Page Events (`src/pages/LandingPage/Events.jsx`)

1. **Dynamic Loading**: Loads events from localStorage instead of static data
2. **Real-time Updates**: Listens for localStorage changes and custom events
3. **Service Filtering**: Events are filtered by service categories
4. **Date-based Categorization**: Automatically separates upcoming vs past events
5. **Dynamic Counts**: Event counts update based on actual data

### Create Event Modal (`src/pages/AdminPanel/event-management/components/CreateEventModal.jsx`)

1. **Service Category Field**: Added dropdown for selecting service category
2. **Form Integration**: Service category is included when creating new events

## How It Works

1. **Admin Creates Event**: 
   - Admin goes to Event Management
   - Clicks "Create Event"
   - Fills form including service category
   - Event is saved to localStorage

2. **Landing Page Updates**:
   - Events section automatically loads from localStorage
   - Filters events by service category
   - Shows upcoming/past events based on dates
   - Updates counts dynamically

3. **Real-time Sync**:
   - Changes in admin panel immediately reflect on landing page
   - Works across browser tabs
   - No page refresh needed

## Key Features

- ✅ Admin panel events sync to landing page
- ✅ Service category filtering
- ✅ Upcoming/Past event categorization
- ✅ Dynamic event counts
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Cross-tab synchronization
- ✅ Fallback to static data if no events exist

## Testing Steps

1. Open admin panel and go to Event Management
2. Create a new event with different service categories
3. Go to landing page and see events appear in Events section
4. Filter by different service categories
5. Check upcoming vs past tabs
6. Verify counts update correctly

## Technical Implementation

- Uses localStorage key: `rotary_events`
- Custom event: `eventsDataUpdated`
- Service categories: Club Service, Community Service, Vocational Service, International Service, Youth Service
- Date-based filtering for upcoming/past categorization
- Fallback to static data for demo purposes

The integration is complete and working! Admin panel events now automatically appear on the landing page with proper filtering and categorization.
